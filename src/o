|  there are  94.0  electrons in the neutral molecule hence best choice is  47.0  orbitals
|  read_vec from:   proj.dat  OM  1 - 146 
 routines.make_table for data conversion (should be rewrite someday)
| ==>   highest MO: (hit return for all MOs)  : [47.0] max= 146 :|             I will take all  47.0  orbitals
|     Select MOs 1- 47  among  146  MOs from  proj.dat to  proj.orbb  in .orb format
